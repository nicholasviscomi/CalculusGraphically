Built with my knowledge of  and for HL Math A&A Y1 HL
Will not necessarily be compatible with other calculus courses

Opens to a menu where you can select a calculus topic
    Topics:
        Graphing Tool: just desmos essentially
        Transformations: translations, reflections, stretches, compressions, advanced
        Differentiation: limit definition, show d/dx (and d2/dx2) at point on curve
        Properties of Curves: sign diagrams for functions
        Integration: rectangle approximation approaching 0 width
