# Calculus Graphically

**
Built with my knowledge of  and for HL Math A&A Y1 HL. It will not necessarily be compatible with other calculus courses
**
 
### Topics Covered: 
1) Graphing Tool: just desmos essentially  
2) Transformations: translations, reflections, stretches, compressions, advanced
3) Differentiation: limit definition, show d/dx (and d2/dx2) at point on curve  
4) Properties of Curves: sign diagrams for functions  
5) Integration: rectangle approximation approaching 0 width

### Current Progress:

- Graph essentially any function (no e or pi, however) 
  - Doesn't work with anysmptotes but will in the future (e.x. y = tan(x))
- View first derivative function
- See tangent line at any point and the slope. Size of tangent line changes with magnitude of slope
- Animation of the limit definition of a derivative
- Interact with a rectangle approximation of an integral from specified bounds

### Download & Run
No special libraries were used. Clone/download the repository and run it.  
You must have java downloaded on your device, although I am unsure what version you must have. I am on "17.0.3.1" if that helps

To check if you have java downloaded, run `java -version`  
It should return something like this:  
`java version "17.0.3.1" 2022-04-22 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.3.1+2-LTS-6)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.3.1+2-LTS-6, mixed mode, sharing)`
