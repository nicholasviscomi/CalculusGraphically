[x] make a function that draws a line between two x values
    --> can be used to graph the derivative and animate the limit definition of a derivative
[x] ensure the integral thing works everywhere
    --> I don't think it will work below and above the x-axis in one go
[x] if the user has show_tangent && show_derivative, have a circle track on the derivative graph when the mouse moves
[x] make the code more modular such that you can graph multiple things at once
[x] graph derivative when the mouse is clicked

[x] To make designing easier: make an integral, derivative, and transformations class that extends JPanel. Then
    style it and return it. This is a much better option than making some generic "Section" class.
    [x] Design differentiation section
    [x] Design integration section
    [ ] Design transformations section

[ ] Make asymptotes work
[ ] add a history of previously graphed stuff
