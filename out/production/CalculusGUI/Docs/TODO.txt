[x] make a function that draws a line between two x values
    --> can be used to graph the derivative and animate the limit definition of a derivative
[x] ensure the integral thing works everywhere
    --> I don't think it will work below and above the x-axis in one go
[ ] if the user has show_tangent && show_derivative, have a circle track on the derivative graph when the mouse moves
[ ] Make a function that loops through an array of values and creates labels for them
    --> should make it easier to display slope, area, width, etc.
[ ] make the code more modular such that you can graph multiple things at once
[ ] graph derivative when the mouse is clicked
[ ] add a history of previously graphed stuff
