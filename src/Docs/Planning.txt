1) Build an easy to use graphing engine
...
2) Add in the main menu
3) Code each topic

Within the graphing file:
    Have a giant map where the keys are all the x values from -width/2 up to width/2 in increment of 0.05
    This is the increment used when finding the y-values for the function. Then when you graph a function,
    just go through the map and put the y-value as the value for the x-value key (points[x-value] = y-value)
        Doesn't work because it will connect points incorrectly (granted that you just connect the current
        point to the previous one)

    Maybe just have a linked list for each function that gets drawn. You calculate the points and it returns
    the start node that can then be traversed forwards. This should also help make animation easier. To store
    and draw multiple functions, keep an array of Head Nodes. In the drawing function, just go through every
    head node (aka function) and draw it!
