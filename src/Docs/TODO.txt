[x] make a function that draws a line between two x values
    --> can be used to graph the derivative and animate the limit definition of a derivative
[x] ensure the integral thing works everywhere
    --> I don't think it will work below and above the x-axis in one go
[x] if the user has show_tangent && show_derivative, have a circle track on the derivative graph when the mouse moves
[x] make the code more modular such that you can graph multiple things at once
[x] graph derivative when the mouse is clicked

[ ] Make the Sections expandable and collapsable
[ ] Design differentiation section
[ ] Design integration section
[ ] Design transformations section

[ ] Make asymptotes work
[ ] add a history of previously graphed stuff
